# P2P Loan Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on the analysis of peer-to-peer (P2P) loan data. The primary objective is to understand the factors influencing the decision to grant loans to clients. 

## Data Cleaning

The initial phase involved data cleaning to ensure the quality and reliability of the data set. This process included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting some inconsistent entries not all though because majority of them were invaluable to med.

## Data Visualization

Visualizations were created to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the data. These visualizations highlighted key trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.

## Variable Relationships

A significant part of the analysis was dedicated to exploring the relationships between variables. This helped to understand whether the decision to grant a loan was influenced by factors such as homeownership or income level.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed that loan approval is indeed influenced by factors such as whether clients are homeowners or have higher income. These insights can be instrumental in refining loan approval processes and criteria.
